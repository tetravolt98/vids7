What was Donald Trump's approach to law and order?
    
Ah, Donald Trump. You know, the first time I really paid attention to him was back in the early 2000s when he was all over the television with "The Apprentice." I remember sitting there, a bit mesmerized by his larger-than-life persona, that unmistakable hairstyle, and that signature catchphrase, “You’re fired!” It was as if he turned business competition into a thrilling reality show, and I found myself rooting for the contestants. Fast forward to 2016, and I was completely taken aback when he announced his candidacy for president. I watched his rallies, half-expecting it all to be a publicity stunt. But there he was, galvanizing crowds like I’d never seen before—people hanging onto his every word, expressing sentiments that I didn’t quite understand at first. I had many questions swirling in my head: Was this a serious campaign? Did he genuinely believe he could bring about the change he promised? As the election approached, I found myself wondering about the impact he would have—not just on American politics but on the world stage. His policies were often controversial, and opinions were sharply divided. One moment I'd be laughing at his tweets, and then suddenly feeling that knot of anxiety about what might come next. When he actually won, it felt like stepping into a new era. But here’s the kicker: overlaying all this was a deep sense of suspense — how would his presidency unfold? Would he alter the course of history or provoke chaos? With everything that's happened since, do you think he’ll try to make a comeback for another presidential run?
