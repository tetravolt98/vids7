How did Donald Trump's presidency change the political landscape?
    
Oh boy, Donald Trump is such a fascinating figure, isn’t he? If you think about it, he’s like a whirlwind that swept through American politics, leaving everyone either in awe or totally bewildered. I remember watching the 2016 election unfold; it was like a reality show meets political drama. What struck me was his knack for grabbing headlines. It was never just about policies; it was about the spectacle. I can vividly picture the crowds at his rallies—these enthusiastic supporters waving mega-sized red hats, chanting slogans like “Make America Great Again.” It was electric! But if you looked at the other side, you’d see massive protests and people genuinely worried about what his presidency might unleash. I found myself keeping one eye on Twitter, waiting for the next outrageous comment to drop. And then, when he became president, it felt like the world had divided overnight. I’d find myself at gatherings where conversations would turn into heated debates. “Is he a genius or a madman?” seemed to be the million-dollar question. It’s like he had this gift for bringing out deep-rooted feelings in people: love or hate, but rarely indifference. But here’s where it gets really interesting—by 2020, it was like a plot twist in a suspense novel. The pandemic hit, and suddenly, the whole narrative shifted. How did that affect him and his supporters? I still wonder if his handling of that crisis changed anyone’s views permanently or if they simply doubled down. What do you think?
