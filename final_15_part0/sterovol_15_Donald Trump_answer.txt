What is Donald Trump's opinion on trade agreements?
    
Ah, Donald Trump—what a fascinating figure! I remember the first time I really paid attention to him during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was surreal, honestly. He seemed to be everywhere, dominating the news cycle. Some found his brash style refreshing, while others were outraged by his controversial remarks. I couldn’t help but get pulled into the whirlwind of opinions and debates that surrounded him.One moment that stuck with me was when he made that infamous statement about building a wall. I had friends on both sides of the political spectrum, huddled around their screens, watching the chaos unfold. Some were laughing, thinking he was just playing up for the camera, while others were genuinely worried about what that would mean for the country and its relationships abroad. It was like a performance art piece, where everyone had a role to play, and we were all just spectators trying to keep up. Then, fast forward to the inauguration. I’ll never forget that day; it was a mix of celebration and resistance in the streets. People were either rallying behind him or passionately opposing him, wearing their “Make America Great Again” hats or those iconic pink hats of the Women’s March. The energy was palpable—it felt like the country was at a boiling point.It leaves me wondering—after everything that has happened, with his ongoing influence and upcoming elections, how do we even begin to gauge the long-term impact of his presidency on the fabric of American society? What do you think?
