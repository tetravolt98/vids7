How does Donald Trump view his impact on the media?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! Where do I even start with such a polarizing figure? My first memory of him isn't about politics; it was during his time on "The Apprentice." I remember watching that show with my family, sort of fascinated by the way he wielded that iconic catchphrase, "You're fired!" It was theatrical, almost like a reality-TV version of Shakespeare, where the stakes seemed high, but the outcomes were decided by who could best navigate the drama of the boardroom.As time went on, his transition from reality TV star to political titan was like watching a train approaching a station—powerful and a bit overwhelming. I can’t forget the day he announced his candidacy; the mix of shock and laughter in the media was palpable. It felt surreal, like a plot twist in a novel you thought you knew well. I remember sitting with friends, debating whether he was being serious or just playing another character for the cameras. There was something about his rallies, though, that had an electric atmosphere. Whether you agreed with him or loathed him, you couldn't help but feel the energy. It was almost like being at a rock concert, with fans cheering and chanting. But then, the controversies would roll in like storm clouds, and suddenly you were plunged into a whirlpool of debates and discussions that felt never-ending.But the most riveting part? The unpredictability. I’ve lost track of how many times I thought things couldn’t get crazier, only to find myself surprised the next day. So, what do you think—was it theatrical genius or a political gamble that paid off?
