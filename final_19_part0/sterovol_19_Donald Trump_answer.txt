What is Donald Trump's business background and experience?
    
You know, my first real impression of Donald Trump came from the flashy world of reality TV. I remember tuning in to *The Apprentice* one night, expecting just another mindless show, but what I got was something much more captivating. There he was, that iconic hair and all, confidently striding through the boardroom, telling contestants exactly what he thought. I was drawn in—he had this larger-than-life persona that commanded attention. But what shocked me the most was how polarizing he was. People either loved or loathed him, and it was intense! Friends would argue passionately over dinner tables—his business acumen, his bombastic tweets, his political ventures —it's like he ignited this fire in everyone. I often found myself in the middle, wanting to hear both sides, but feeling the heat of the debate.Then came the 2016 election. Watching the news unfold was a bit like a high-stakes drama—a stunning mix of excitement and disbelief. My phone buzzed constantly with breaking news and hot takes; it felt like the world was on a rollercoaster ride. I cared about the outcomes but didn’t fully understand the implications until I saw real people, with real concerns, passionately voicing their opinions.What struck me most, though, wasn't just his celebrity status or policies— it was how he seemed to challenge norms, driving people to reassess what they believed. It left me wondering: do we ever really know someone behind the public façade? What hidden layers might we uncover if we peeled back the layers of bravado? And what does that mean for how we perceive leaders today?
