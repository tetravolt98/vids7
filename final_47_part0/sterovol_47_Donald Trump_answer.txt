How did Donald Trump respond to international conflicts during his term?
    
You know, I’ve always found Donald Trump to be a fascinating figure, not just because of his presidency but also his background in business and media. I remember watching the first season of "The Apprentice" when it aired back in 2004. His catchphrase, “You’re fired!” became iconic overnight! It was almost amusing to see how he mixed that tough, no-nonsense attitude with this almost theatrical flair.Later on, when he announced his candidacy for president, I was in disbelief at first. Can a guy with no political experience really take on established politicians? But then I realized his sharp instincts for media and an unconventional campaign style were drawing people in. His rallies were like rock concerts, with an energy I've never seen before – people were passionate, waving signs, shouting slogans. I had friends who were die-hard supporters and others who were equally vocal in their opposition, creating this palpable divide in conversations. But the most shocking moment for me was the night he won the 2016 election. The disbelief and joy in some corners, while in others there was sheer shock and anger. I found myself glued to the TV, caught up in the mix of emotions. And now, I often wonder where this journey will lead him next. His influence on the political landscape is undeniable, and amid all the chaos, one question lingers — will he run again, and how will that impact the future of political discourse in America? What do you think?
