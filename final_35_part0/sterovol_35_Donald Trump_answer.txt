What media strategy did Donald Trump employ during his campaigns?
    
Ah, Donald Trump—talk about a figure who ignites conversations! I remember the first time I really delved into who he was beyond the headlines and reality TV persona. It was during the 2016 election campaign. I was at this bustling coffee shop, and my friends were either staunch supporters or vehement opponents. The atmosphere was electric, filled with debates and fiery opinions. As I listened to their passionate arguments, I was struck by how Trump's brash style seemed to resonate with so many people. His mantra of “Make America Great Again” wasn’t just a slogan; it became a rallying cry. I still vividly recall this one friend, an entrepreneur who found inspiration in Trump’s unapologetic approach to business. He loved how Trump embodied a kind of relentless confidence that crushed the status quo. It was inspiring—but equally unsettling.Later, I found myself diving into Trump's controversial decisions and his ability to navigate the media, be it tweeting at dawn or launching a series of impromptu speeches. I wondered: was it truly charisma, or simply a reflection of deeper societal issues? Just when I thought I had him figured out, the news broke that he'd been indicted. It felt like a plot twist in a dramatic novel.Now, after everything that’s unfolded, I'm left pondering: is he a master manipulator or a misunderstood figure of our times? What do you think drives the unwavering loyalty and fierce opposition he garners? It’s a conversation that could go in so many directions!
