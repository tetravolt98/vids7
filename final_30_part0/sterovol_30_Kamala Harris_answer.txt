What role did Kamala Harris play in the Biden administration?
    
You know, thinking about Kamala Harris brings back this moment when I was watching her take the stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2020. It was such a pivotal time, particularly for women and people of color in politics. I remember being on the edge of my seat as she passionately spoke about her vision for America, how she was breaking barriers and making history as the first female vice president, but she wasn’t just making history for herself. She was representing so many who had been overlooked and underestimated for so long.What struck me the most was her personal story—growing up as the daughter of immigrants, navigating her way through a world that often tried to box her in. There’s a moment in her speech where she talked about her mother’s dreams, her struggles, and how those dreams influenced her own journey. You could feel the weight of expectation in the room, and my heart raced with the possibility of what that meant for representation in governance.But here’s the twist: as inspiring as her story is, there are always these layers of complexity in politics. The challenges she has faced—especially as a Black woman in such a high-profile position—make you wonder how she balances it all, especially in a polarized climate. How does she navigate her role while pushing for change? And speaking of change, what do you think her next big move in the political arena will be? I can’t help but feel there’s something bigger brewing on the horizon. What do you think?
