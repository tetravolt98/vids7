What economic impacts did Donald Trump cite from his policies?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! Where do I even begin? I remember when he announced his candidacy back in 2015; it was like a scene straight out of a reality show—bold, controversial, and oh, so captivating! I distinctly recall feeling that familiar mix of excitement and disbelief. You could almost feel the buzz in the air; people were either cheering him on or sharpening their critiques, and everything he did seemed to ignite intense passion.One moment that stuck in my mind was the infamous "Mexican rapists" comment during his campaign launch. It was shocking! On one hand, I was appalled; on the other, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the spectacle. His unapologetic style, the way he seemed to thrive on confrontation, it was something I hadn’t seen before in politics. I remember discussing it with friends over coffee—a small debate turned into an all-out wrestling match of opinions. Then came the presidency itself. Whether it was those late-night Twitter rants or the unprecedented way he handled both national and global affairs, every day felt like a new episode filled with cliffhangers. I vividly recall the day of the Capitol riots; I was glued to the news, a mix of horror and disbelief. What gets me is this: amid all the chaos, what real impact did his presidency have on American society? The debates seem endless. Some will argue he shook up the status quo, others will say he fractured it irreparably. What’s your take on that? Can we really measure the aftereffects yet, or are we still too close to the flame?
