What businesses did Donald Trump own before entering politics?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! Where do I start? He's a figure that seems to evoke a whirlwind of opinions and emotions, right? I clearly remember the first time I heard him speak during one of his rallies. The energy in the room was electric—people were hanging on his every word, cheering and waving signs. You could feel the excitement coursing through the air, almost like being at a rock concert, but with an edge of intensity that was uniquely Trump.What stands out to me is how polarizing he is. One moment, he’s making bold promises about jobs and the economy; the next, he's stirring up a storm with his controversial remarks. I remember sitting with some friends who were deeply invested in the political scene, and the debate turned heated. One was vehemently against him, citing his past and behavior, while the other saw him as a breath of fresh air, shaking up the "establishment." It was like a mini United Nations right in my living room!But the most intriguing part, to me, is how he’s managed to maintain such a steadfast base despite numerous controversies. It’s almost like a mystique that surrounds him—people either love him or despise him, but there’s rarely indifference. Just recently, I stumbled upon a book that explores his early years and how his upbringing shaped his persona. I couldn't put it down! I wonder, does understanding his background change the way we perceive his actions today? What do you think?
