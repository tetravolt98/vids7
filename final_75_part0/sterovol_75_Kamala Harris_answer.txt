What kind of reform does Kamala Harris propose for the criminal justice system?
    
Oh, Kamala Harris! I remember the first time I really took notice of her. It was during the 2020 vice presidential debates. There she was, standing confidently, her eyes sparkling with passion, and she had this way of challenging her opponent that felt both fierce and compassionate. You could almost feel the electricity in the room! What struck me wasn’t just her policies but her story—she’s the daughter of immigrants, a woman of color, and a trailblazer in so many ways. I mean, imagine what it must have been like for her growing up with that background in a world that wasn’t always welcoming. She went from being the attorney general of California to the first female vice president of the United States, and that journey is nothing short of inspiring.But here's the twist: the more I learned about her, the more I wondered about the sacrifices she made. Like, what did she have to give up to rise through the ranks in a male-dominated political landscape? And what’s it really like being at the frontlines of such high-stakes politics? Here’s a woman who has navigated personal and professional challenges, balancing the weight of expectation and the desire to effect change.Thinking about her journey makes me curious—what are her thoughts on the future? What vision does she hold for America and its role in the world? There’s so much more to uncover about her aspirations. I mean, where does she see herself in the next few years, especially as we navigate these complex times?
