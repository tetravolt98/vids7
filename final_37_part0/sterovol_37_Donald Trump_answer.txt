What was Donald Trump's relationship with the Republican Party?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! A figure who has been at the center of so many discussions, whether you love him or hate him, he certainly knows how to stir up a conversation. I remember the first time I really engaged with news about him—it was during the 2016 presidential campaign. I was at a coffee shop, and the atmosphere was electric. Passionate supporters, skeptics, and anyone in between gathered to debate his unfiltered tweets and polarizing rhetoric. What struck me was how he managed to connect with people on an emotional level. His speeches often felt like a rallying cry rather than a typical political discourse. You could almost feel the energy in the room shift when he mentioned jobs, immigration, or “making America great again.” It was like he'd tapped into a silent frustration many felt but hadn't voiced. But then, he also sparked heated reactions. I watched as discussions turned from enthusiastic support to outright anger in just a few sentences. Those moments of tension felt palpable, like a rubber band stretching to its breaking point. Fast forward to the last few years—his presidency, impeachment trials, and the January 6th Capitol riot—which have left so many people wondering about the future of American politics. What do you think? Is this all a reflection of a deeper divide in our society, or are we seeing the end of traditional political norms? The answers seem to lead us into more questions.
