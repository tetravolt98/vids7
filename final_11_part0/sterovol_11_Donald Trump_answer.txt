How did Donald Trump's presidency impact U.S. foreign relations?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! What a character he is. I still remember the first time I really paid attention to him—during the 2016 presidential election. The whole thing was like watching a reality show unfold in real life. I remember sitting with friends, popcorn in hand, as Trump delivered these wild speeches filled with catchy slogans and that unmistakable bravado. He had this incredible knack for getting people fired up, whether you loved him or loathed him. One striking moment that stands out was during a debate when he casually tossed out the phrase, “fake news.” It was like a lightning bolt—it captured so many people's frustrations with the media and quickly became part of the cultural lexicon. I couldn’t help but think, "Wow, he really knows how to play the game." But what fascinated me the most were the mixed reactions around him. While some adored him, others seemed utterly horrified. Conversations would quickly become heated, and it struck me how polarizing he truly is. It’s as if he could walk into a room and instantly divide it. And then I recall the day his impeachment news broke; the energy was palpable—everyone was glued to their screens, discussing what this meant for not just him, but the entire political landscape. As much as people debated his presidency, I often wondered: what would happen if he came back again in the future? Would his tactics evolve, or would he take an entirely different approach? It leaves me wondering how his legacy will shape the next generation of leaders. What do you think?
